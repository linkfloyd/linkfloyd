        <h3>What is Linkfloyd?</h3>

        <p>Simply it's a link sharing and bookmarking service based on interest groups. It's a source for high quality content in your interest from web.</p>

        <h3>Which problem does it solve?</h3>

        <p>We usually follow people on social media because of we have same area of common interests with them. For example i'm following a few people, because they are interested in photography as me. Sometimes they write blog posts, or share article links about photography. So the reason of why i follow them is "photography". Everything seems okay until here. But the problem is, when we follow people, we are starting to follow everything that they share. I am not interested of their familiy life, musical taste, or blog posts about their travels.</p>

        <p>When you register to linkfloyd. You interact with interest channels instead of people. For example subscribing to "photography" channel means that you will see posts about photography. Or posting a link to "photography" channel means that you're posting your content people whom interested. So there is no trash, you're always with clean content.</p>

        <h3>What is channel?</h3>
        <p>It's like tv channel for the web content. Linkfloyd only shows links from channels that you subscribed.</p>

        <h3>Does anybody can submit a link?</h3>
        <p>Yes, all you need is an <a href="/accounts/register/">account</a>!</p>

        <h3>What is "Rating" of a link?</h3>

        <p>When you're posting a link, you can see rating input at the submit form like this:</p>

        <p><img alt="Rating" class="bordered" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-meCwZoKjQ_g/T4R5G75o82I/AAAAAAAAC-c/pq3PfiygmNE/s720/Screenshot%2520at%25202012-04-10%252021%253A08%253A46.png"></p>

        <p>Rating system is inspired from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_content_rating_systems">television content rating systems</a>. It's purpose is give viewers an idea of the suitability of a link for their morality.</p>

        <p>You can go to your preferences page set your maximum rating. For example if you set it to "safe", you will not see any links that contains obscenity or küfürlü content.</p>

        <h3>What is number near links?</h3>

        <p>It's vote score of link, simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the post and three users don't, it will have a score of 2.</p>
